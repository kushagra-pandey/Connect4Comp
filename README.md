# Connect4Comp

Are you bored and want to play a little game of connect 4? Then simply run this file!
You will be playing against a semi-smart computer that has the ability to check for your future wins (so you can't trick it
by putting 3 in a row and hoping it won't notice) and its own future wins (same scenario as above, except this time the
computer has 3 in a row). It may seem deceptively simple, but it beat my middle school brother 50% of the time! See if you
can game the system. I promise it's fun!
